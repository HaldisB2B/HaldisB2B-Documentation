## 🚀 For AI Developers: How to Migrate Your Documentation

### Your Documentation is Valuable Organizational Knowledge!

The comprehensive documentation you've created contains patterns and insights that should be shared across all HaldisB2B projects.

### 📋 Migration Checklist for Your Assets

Based on your documentation inventory:

**✅ Admin & User Guide (3,800+ lines)**
- Target: `project-docs/[your-project]/admin-user-guide.md`
- Extract reusable patterns to: `templates/project-docs/USER-GUIDE-template.md`

**✅ Software Architecture Document (4,500+ lines)**
- Target: `project-docs/[your-project]/architecture.md`
- Extract patterns to: `knowledge-base/architecture-patterns/`

**✅ Developer Guide (5,200+ lines)**
- Target: `project-docs/[your-project]/developer-guide.md`
- Extract standards to: `standards/development/`

**✅ AI Development Process** ⭐ HIGHEST VALUE
- Target: `knowledge-base/ai-development/process-overview.md`
- This methodology is organizational gold - highly reusable!

**✅ API Contracts**
- Target: `project-docs/[your-project]/api-contracts/`
- Extract templates to: `templates/api-contracts/`

**✅ Phase 1 Architecture**
- Target: `project-docs/[your-project]/phase1-architecture.md`
- Extract patterns to: `knowledge-base/architecture-patterns/`
