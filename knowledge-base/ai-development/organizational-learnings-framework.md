## Data Collection Strategy

### Phase 1: Asset Inventory (Immediate)
**For Each AI Developer Project:**
1. **Documentation Review**
   - Collect existing project documentation
   - Identify key decisions and rationale
   - Extract architectural diagrams and specifications
   - Capture API contracts and interfaces

2. **Code Analysis**
   - Review repository structure and organization
   - Identify recurring patterns and conventions
   - Document configuration and setup procedures
   - Extract reusable components and utilities

3. **Process Documentation**
   - Capture development workflows used
   - Document testing and quality assurance approaches
   - Record deployment and operational procedures
   - Identify communication and collaboration patterns

### Phase 2: Pattern Extraction (1-2 weeks)
**Analysis and Synthesis:**
1. **Cross-Project Analysis**
   - Compare approaches across different projects
   - Identify successful patterns and anti-patterns
   - Document trade-offs and decision criteria
   - Extract reusable templates and frameworks

2. **Best Practice Identification**
   - Consolidate most effective approaches
   - Document standard operating procedures
   - Create decision trees and guidelines
   - Establish quality criteria and metrics

3. **Gap Analysis**
   - Identify missing documentation or processes
   - Highlight areas needing standardization
   - Document unresolved challenges
   - Prioritize improvement opportunities

### Phase 3: Organizational Integration (2-4 weeks)
**Knowledge Systematization:**
1. **Template Creation**
   - Extract project setup templates
   - Create documentation templates
   - Develop process templates and checklists
   - Establish architectural pattern libraries

2. **Standards Development**
   - Codify best practices into organizational standards
   - Create compliance checklists and guidelines
   - Develop quality assurance frameworks
   - Establish performance and security benchmarks

3. **Training Material Creation**
   - Develop onboarding guides for new AI developers
   - Create technical training materials
   - Document common troubleshooting procedures
   - Establish mentoring and support frameworks

## Implementation Approach

### Data Collection Methods

#### 1. Automated Documentation Harvesting
```bash
# Script to collect project documentation
for project in project-list; do
    find $project -name "*.md" -o -name "*.txt" -o -name "README*"
    git log --oneline --since="3 months ago" $project
    find $project -name "package.json" -o -name "requirements.txt" -o -name "*.yml"
done
```

#### 2. Structured Interview Process
**For Each AI Developer Project:**
- **Technical Interview**: Architecture decisions, challenges, solutions
- **Process Interview**: Development workflow, collaboration patterns
- **Retrospective**: What worked, what didn't, lessons learned
- **Recommendations**: Improvements for future projects

#### 3. Artifact Collection
- **Code Repositories**: Full repository analysis and pattern extraction
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation review and synthesis
- **Configuration Files**: Infrastructure and tooling configurations
- **Communication Records**: Decision logs, meeting notes, issue discussions
